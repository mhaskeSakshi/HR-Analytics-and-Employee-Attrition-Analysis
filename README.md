1.Project Title
HR Analytics and Employee Attrition Analysis

2. Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee data to understand the factors contributing to employee attrition. The analysis includes data cleansing, exploration, visualization, and insights extraction to help the organization reduce employee turnover and improve retention strategies.
3. Objective
The main objective is to identify the key drivers of employee attrition and to provide actionable insights that can be used by HR departments to improve employee retention.
4. Data Source
The dataset used for this project is an HR dataset that contains information on employee demographics, job roles, work environment, and attrition status.
5. Data Cleansing
Removed unnecessary columns that do not contribute to the analysis.
Renamed columns for better readability and consistency.
Eliminated duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
Handled missing values by either imputing or removing them, depending on the context.
6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and central tendencies of the data.
Visualized the distribution of key variables like age, monthly income, job roles, and departments using histograms and bar charts.
Analyzed the correlation between different numerical features to identify potential relationships.
7. Key Insights and Visualizations
Attrition Rate by Department: Created a bar chart to show which departments have the highest attrition rates.
Gender Distribution of Attrition: Used a pie chart to visualize the gender distribution among employees who have left the company.
Monthly Income vs. Attrition: Explored the relationship between monthly income and attrition, identifying income brackets with higher attrition rates.
Heatmap of Correlation Matrix: Visualized correlations between numerical features to identify factors that might influence attrition.
8. Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
9. Challenges Faced
Handling missing values and outliers.
Ensuring that the visualizations were clear and interpretable.
Balancing the need for comprehensive analysis with the complexity of the dataset.
10. Conclusion
Summarize the key findings of the analysis, such as the most significant factors leading to employee attrition, and suggest strategies for reducing turnover based on the data.
